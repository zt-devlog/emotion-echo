# Emotion Echo 🌈🧠

**Emotion Echo** is an interactive web app that reflects user emotions through soft atmospheric visuals, inspirational messages, and personalized journal entries.

When users type an emotion in English, the app displays a curated message, a matching background image via the Unsplash API, and advice related to their current feeling. It also stores each interaction in a local "emotion diary" for personal reflection.
