/**
 * Project Statement: Emotion Echo - A web application that reflects user emotions
 * using dynamic visuals, poetic reflections, and a personal diary.
 *
 * Author: Zoe Thompson DTC 477 
 *
 * Scripting Steps:
 * 1.  Event Handling: Listens for form submission to capture user input.
 * 2.  Emotion Processing:  Retrieves data (message, color, keywords) based on the input emotion.
 * 3.  Dynamic Display: Updates the UI with emotion-specific content and visuals.
 * 4.  API Interaction: Fetches background images from Unsplash and reflections.
 * 5.  Local Storage: Saves and retrieves diary entries for persistent storage.
 * 6.  Modular Functions: Encapsulates functionality into reusable blocks.
 * 7.  Error Handling: Manages potential issues with API requests and data retrieval.
 *
 * AI Usage Narrative:
 * -   Ideation: ChatGPT was used to refine the initial feature set.
 * -   Planning: ChatGPT aided in designing the data structure for 'emotionData' and outlining the application's workflow.
 * -   Debugging: ChatGPT helped identify and resolve issues with asynchronous operations and DOM manipulation.
 * -   Code Refinement: ChatGPT assisted in improving code readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
 *  Overall, ChatGPT was used for this project to help refine my code, and help me learn how to make it more efficient.
